A old .Net web project i did in my advanced webdev class in 2015

Read the document brief for more detailed information.

Non of it will really work now since the EVE ONLINE API has changed signifcantly in the last seven years. But at the time it was a simple XML API that allowed someone to use a player key to get information about the character or corp they were part of. We used this for fourms, security checks, fits menu, timers etc for day to day operations of our 300 person alliance.

The website was actually live for around 18Months before i quit the game and lost track and the domain lapsed.
